My journey in technology began in a modest town, where my fascination with human-tech interaction grew into a passion for software development and UI/UX design. With over 11 years of experience, I specialize in Next.js, React.js, Vue.js, TailwindCSS, PHP, Laravel, and Python for AI.

My creative toolkit includes Figma for UI/UX design, CorelDRAW, Canva, Flutter for mobile apps, and WordPress as my preferred CMS. I've led innovative projects like transforming online education with user-friendly platforms and developing AI-powered apps for environmental monitoring.

I seamlessly blend functionality with aesthetics, earning a reputation as a visionary. Constantly exploring tech trends, my work reflects a relentless pursuit of excellence and innovation.
